# oso: authorization as code [Django Integration Example]

oso allows you to write policy as code, tightly integrated
with application code, logic, and data, and provides a simple
way to enforce authorization on all requests.

## Example

This repository contains an example application using oso
and the oso Django integration to secure requests.

The application itself is a simple Django
web server, implementing an expenses application.

We used the ``oso`` & ``django-oso`` libraries.
